Any relevant Licence from the orignal repo. are applicable.
if anyone from StarLabs has a problem with this repo, notify me - I'll take it down

This is anyway just for ease repo, Where after the refresh i found it difficult to apply the cursor theme on my non-starlabs desktop, and i think i am not the only one
